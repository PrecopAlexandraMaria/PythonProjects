# My Data Structures and Algorithms projects

# Assigment 1:
ADT Set – represented as a dynamic array of Boolean values. For example the set {5, 1, -4, 0, 8} 
can be represented as an array of 13 elements where position 0 corresponds to element 
4, position 1 corresponds to element -3, …, position 12 corresponds to element 8: [true, false, false,
false, true, true, false, false, false, true, false, false, true].

# Assigment 2:
ADT SortedBag – using a DLL with (element, frequency) pairs. Pairs are ordered based on a 
relation between the elements. 

# Assigment 3:
ADT SortedBag – using a DLLA with (element, frequency) pairs. Pairs are ordered based on a relation 
between the elements. 

# Assigment 4:
ADT SortedBag – using a hashtable with separate chaining for storing the elements. If an 
element appears multiple times, it will be stored multiple times in the hashtable. 

# Assigment 5:
ADT SortedBag – using a BST with linked representation with dynamic allocation. If an 
element appears multiple times, it will be stored multiple times in the BST.
