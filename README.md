My college python projects

Assigment 1:
1.1) Compute the control digit of an integer by summing up its digits, then summing up the digits of the sum, so on, until a sum of only one digit is obtained.
e.g. The control digit of integer number 1971 is 9 (1971 → 18 → 9).

1.5) Determine the value of the element at index k in the array 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4,… without reading or effectively creating the array.
e.g. Input: k = 35, Output: 8

1.9) Print all numbers with maximum 2 digits of form xy with the property that the last digit of (xy)^2 is y.
e.g. 5^2=25 or 10^2=100 or 76^2=5776.

1.13) Read a natural number n. Form another number from its digits found at odd positions (from left to right).
e.g. Input: 1234, Output: 13

1.17) A number n is special if there is a natural number m such that n = m + S(m), where S(m) is the sum of digits of m. Verify if a given number is special.
e.g. 1235 is special (1235=1225+10)
